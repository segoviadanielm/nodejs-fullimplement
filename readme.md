### NODE JS - FULL IMPLEMENTATION

The purpose of this project is to go a bit further away from the NodeJs roadmap present [here](https://github.com/aliyr/Nodejs-Developer-Roadmap/blob/master/ReadMe.md)

The principal objective is, based on [NodeJS Documentation](https://nodejs.org/api/documentation.html), all through, make two implementations: 

1) "theoretical implementation" - file with the entry name of the doc page and some examples and comments
2) "practical implementation" - mix with one or more files making a real example of the use for the theoretical implementation.

the searched consequence of this formal practice is to through a real experience of studying all the capabilities of the technology represented on the docs.

> ðŸ’¡ You can see the project is separate on two folders `javascript and typescript`, and it's intencional



The vanilla js implementation of NodeJS it's ok, but everyone knows about the powerful tool called Typescript. The intention is to replicate the implementation of the js folder with the structure of ts and all their capabilities

### Next Steps

When I finish the doc though, I'll start a project using all the concepts with TS in a new folder
